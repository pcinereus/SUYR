@book{R:Bolker:2008,
	Abstract = {This book is a truly practical introduction to modern
                  statistical methods for ecology.  In step-by-step
                  detail, the book teaches ecology graduate students and
                  researchers everything they need to know in order to
                  use maximum likelihood, information-theoretic, and
                  Bayesian techniques to analyze their own data using
                  the programming language R.  The book shows how to
                  choose among and construct statistical models for
                  data, estimate their parameters and confidence limits,
                  and interpret the results.  The book also covers
                  statistical frameworks, the philosophy of statistical
                  modeling, and critical mathematical functions and
                  probability distributions.  It requires no programming
                  background--only basic calculus and statistics.},
